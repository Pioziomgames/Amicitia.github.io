p4g-pc-fmvs	Slightly Enhanced FMV Mod	P4G	pelvisbass	1	6/17/2020	"FMV, MP4"	The goal of this mod is to make the FMV videos look slightly better however there is only so much that can be done in its current state. For some reason I will never understand atlus decided to encode the FMVs in game with the WMV2 Codec rather than the much more modern AVC codec used for the psvita version of the game. This results in some really bad compression and blocking which in some cases can be distracting. So I decided to use vapoursynth to try my best to fix it up. The results are not perfect as there is a small amount of detail loss and blockiness however in my opinion the results are much better than the originals. If you are interested in it I left the script I used for vapoursytnh as well as my ffmpeg settings in the readme.	 	https://i.slow.pics/PVByenB7.png	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PCTo-RivdmDzRSn8R1gpfBIseR3m400a/view	(PC)	folder-open	 	https://shrinefox.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=376
